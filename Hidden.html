  <text>Love exploring beautiful cities with panoramic views and iconic hot air balloon rides? As much as we all do, many don’t know that behind these beautiful views are even cooler hidden gems located all around the region.
Located in the city of Uchisar and beyond the tourist trails lies the Kadinali, a powerful women-run  restaurant which serves delicious traditional Turkish dishes such as gozleme and yaprak sarma. Not only was this NGO formed to create job opportunities for more women seeking employment, but also never fails to serve a delicious dish!</text>
<p></p>
<text>Hot air balloons aren’t the only sight to see in this region! All around Cappadocia lie multiple art museums exhibiting all the beautiful paintings and sculptures that Cappadocia has to offer. The Guray Museum specifically provides the first underground ceramic museum filled with gorgeous architecture and pottery everywhere. Learn about Avanos’ rich pottery-making history in the underground Guray Museum. With adult prices starting at just 2.23 dollars all you need is a foot in the door and a fresh pair of eyes!

<text>Though Turkey has more than enough attractions above ground, make sure not to ignore the under-ground activities that Turkey also has to offer. The Kaymakli Underground City offers both education and gorgeous natural architecture being over 20 meters deep and supposedly housing over 3500 people including their food and livestock. With just 55.84 explored the Underground city built by the Phygians in the 7th and 8th centuries BCE in order to protect themselves from foreign invaders. Crawl through the mystical city and explore the life of thousands of soldiers while learning as well!</text>

    <h2>Beach</h2>
    <h3>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</h3>
    <text class="text">Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is known as the Marvelous City, and it also is known for its beaches! A well-liked
      one in Rio de Janeiro is Copacabana Beach, and due to its popularity, there are many restaurants and shops to
      visit there. However, if you are looking for a more private experience at a beach, Vermelha Beach has lovely views
      too. This beach is close to Sugarloaf Mountain, which also provides dazzling sights from above after cable car
      rides to reach the peak. Furthermore, Rio de Janeiro has its own share of culture with the large monument of
      Christ the Redeemer. As one of the new seven wonders of the world, this statue of Jesus Christ stretches his arms
      out on top of Corcovado Mountain and over the city. Climbing many steps is part of seeing the statue up close. If
      you are looking to see sights on the ground instead of from a height, visiting Tijuca National Park is a must as
      it features cascading waterfalls and unique types of plants. Exploring this park can be done through a jeep tour.
      It is also significant to note that Rio de Janeiro has a warm climate with February being the hottest month
      (average of 81°F) and July being the coolest (average of 70°F).</text>

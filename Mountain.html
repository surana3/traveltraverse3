  <text>Juneau is in the American state of Alaska, and it contains countless picturesque views of mountains, trees,
    bodies of water, and other aspects of nature. The Goldbelt Tram offers wonderful panoramic sights of Juneau with
    cars that rise at least 900 feet from the cruise ship dock (where the tram ride begins). Beautiful views on the
    ground can also be seen in the Glacier Gardens Rainforest Adventure, which is about a mile away from Juneau
    International Airport. This garden will highlight Alaska’s unique flora! Additionally, the Mendenhall Glacier is one
    of Juneau’s most common attractions, and there are a variety of ways to explore the area nearby (from hiking trails
    to canoe tours). An interesting activity to partake in is whale watching, and many cruises are available to see the
    majestic creatures; however, it is important to know that tours usually start in spring (March-May) and end in
    autumn (September-October). One final note is that Juneau’s climate is a cool one with average temperatures ranging
    from 25°F to 60°F.</text>
